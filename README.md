## Project 1 for my game design class titled: Pan's Labyrinth. Finished on September 11 2021

## Implementation: I added depth to my game by implementing a class system and item pickups. The narrative branches out and expects you to appropriately use your class trait and item accordingly. I recommend playing at least 2 runs with at least one of them with the sage class. I also added a score system that tracks correct choices with 5 points and wrong choices with -10 points. 
## References: general rpg games with class systems like baldur's gate, divinity etc.
## Future development: I would love to implement basic combat, more directions in story and a better item system.
